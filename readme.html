<h1>Installing and Launching Maqetta on Localhost</h1>

<h2 id="supported_browsers">Supported browsers: Google Chrome (current release), Mozilla Firefox (current release) and Mac Safari 5.1</h2>

<h2 id="run_off_cloud">Long-term vision: everyone runs a cloud version of Maqetta (i.e., run off server)</h2>
<p> This README describes how to launch the locally installed version of Maqetta
off of http://localhost. However, it is important to note that
the Maqetta open source team's goal is that ultimately everyone will run Maqetta in the cloud 
(i.e. off of a server), saving files in their cloud workspace. 
The team features of Maqetta, particularly review and commenting,
require users to run the server-based version of the product.</p>
<p>There might be multiple cloud versions of Maqetta. The Maqetta team 
provides a non-commercial, as-is, non-secure, use at your own risk, etc. cloud-hosted version 
of Maqetta at Maqetta.org:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://maqetta.org">http://maqetta.org</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other cloud versions of Maqetta might also be available. 
For example, your company might be hosting a version of Maqetta on an intranet server, 
or other web sites might offer cloud-hosted versions of Maqetta.</p>

<h2 id="local_install">Instructions for installing and running Maqetta locally</h2>

<p>With this option, you download a ZIP file containing Maqetta, double-click on a file to launch
	the Maqetta server on <i>localhost:50000</i>, and then launch Maqetta by
	navigating your browser to <a href="http://localhost:50000/maqetta" rel="external">http://localhost:50000/maqetta</a>.
	As a result, you will be running Maqetta on a &quot;local cloud&quot; where <a href="http://localhost:50000/maqetta" rel="external">http://localhost:50000/maqetta</a>
	simulates a cloud environment. Detailed installation instructions can be found in a subsequent section.
	This approach allows your data to be stored on your local file system, but you cannot use the team features such
	as review and commenting.</p>
<p>Here are the instructions for installing and running Maqetta locally (i.e. http://localhost:50000).</p>

<h3 id="local_install_java">Step 1: Verify you have Java Version 6 or greater installed on your machine.</h3>

<p>Maqetta requires Java Version 6 or greater installed on your machine in order to run Maqetta locally.
(NOTE: It is best to install the latest version of Java so that you have
all of the latest security updates.)</p>

To see if Java is installed, and if so which version, follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li> Open a Command Prompt window
<ul><li>On Windows: Click <b>Start > Run</b>, type in <code style="letter-spacing:1px;">cmd</code> and click OK</li>
    <li>On Mac: Open <b>Finder > Applications > Utilites > Terminal</b></li></ul>
<li>Type in <code>java -version</code></li>
<li>If the version number 1.6.0 or higher, no further action is required.</li>
<li>If the version number is lower than 1.6.0, or you don't have Java on your machine, then you'll need to install
	Java 1.6 (or later) onto your machine.
</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: If you need to download and install Java onto your system, we strongly recommend installing the Java JDK
(Java Development Kit) instead of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), particularly on Windows. On Windows, the JDK
makes the "java" command available to command line tools, whereas with the JRE, you'll need to manually
update the PATH environment variable to point to the <code>bin</code> folder for your Java installation.</p>

<h3 id="local_install_launch_server">Step 2: Launch the Maqetta server</h3>

<p>NOTE: On some Windows systems, you need to expand the Maqetta download ZIP file into a folder for which
you have full read/write permissions. The recommended approach is to expand the Maqetta ZIP file
somewhere inside your user file area at <code>\Users\&lt;mylogin&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: On some MacOS systems, you will need to make sure your Security and Privacy settings allow
applications to run that are downloaded from anywhere. See instructions at: 
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5290">OS X: About Gatekeeper</a>.</p>

<ol><li> With the Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac), navigate to the directory into which you unzipped the Maqetta files.
</li><li> Launch the Maqetta server process.
<ul><li> On Windows, double-click on the file <b>maqetta.server.win.bat</b> (depending on your settings, the Windows explorer might not show the &quot;.bat&quot; extension).
</li><li> On Mac, double-click on the file <b>maqetta.server.mac.command</b> (depending on your settings, the Mac finder might not show the &quot;.command&quot; extension).

</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<p> </p>

<p>You can tell that the server has launched if you see the following message in the shell window:
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<pre>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />NOTE: CLOSING THIS WINDOW WILL <br />      STOP THE MAQETTA SERVER PROCESS<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Using directory : &lt;maqetta-unzip-dir&gt;\users<br />start your browser at http://localhost:50000/maqetta<br /><br />...(various messages might appear here)...<br /><br />osgi&gt;</pre>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<p>Be sure to wait until you see the <code>osgi&gt;</code> prompt appear. That indicates that the server has initialized.</p>
<p>The Maqetta server will continue to run until you close the shell window that comes up after you double-click on the server launch file. Therefore, if you close the shell window, the Maqetta server process will stop running, at which point you can't run <a href="http://localhost:50000/maqetta" rel="external" title="http://localhost:50000/maqetta">http://localhost:50000/maqetta</a> anymore. <br /></p>
<p><i><font color="#ff0000"><b><u>One possible problem</u></b> <font color="#000000">is that you might already be running a different localhost server on your system at <b><u>http://localhost:50000</u></b> (the default for Maqetta). Refer to the detailed notes immediately below about how to change the Maqetta launch script to use a different port number.</font></font></i><br /></p><p /><p><b><i>Detailed notes about the Maqetta server <br /></i></b></p>

<ul><li>On the Mac, you can launch the Maqetta server from the Dock by dragging the <code>maqetta.server.mac.command</code> onto the right part of the doc.</li>
<li>The launch scripts (<b>maqetta.server.win.bat</b> and <b>maqetta.server.mac.command</b>) have some default parameters:
<ul>
<li><b>HTTP port number</b> - The scripts default to port 50000. If you prefer to use 8080 or some other port number, hand-edit the launch script 
and change 50000 to something else (any number in the 50000's is OK).
</li><li><b>User workspace folder</b> - Any files that you create in Maqetta will be saved into a folder managed by the Maqetta server process. You can change the location for where your workspace is saved by hand-editing the launch scripts. <i><b>Note that a future version of Maqetta will allow you to open any file on your local system. The current release can only open files within the workspace area.</b></i><br /><br />The default <b>user workspace folder</b> locations are:<br /><br />

<ul><li>Windows: &lt;maqetta-unzip-dir&gt;\users</li>
<li>Macintosh: &lt;maqetta-unzip-dir&gt;/users</li></ul>

</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="local_install_launch_browser">Step 3: Launch Maqetta application in Google Chrome, Firefox 4 or Mac Safari 5.1</h3>

<p>Once the Maqetta server has been launched (see previous steps), open Chrome, Firefox or Safari and go to the following URL: 
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://localhost:50000/maqetta" rel="external" title="http://localhost:50000/maqetta">http://localhost:50000/maqetta</a>
</li></ul>

<p>You will now see a Maqetta login screen.</p>
<p>The first time you bring up a locally installed version of Maqetta in the browser, 
	<span style='font-weight:bold; color:brown;'>you will need create a new user account by clicking on the Register button</span>, 
	which will take you to the account creation screen.
	For a local installation of Maqetta, the login name can be an email address or any string (e.g., your name). 
	(Note: Local installations do not require that new accounts get verified via activation emails.)
	After clicking Register,
	the Maqetta application should appear.
</p>

<p>In subsequent sessions, you will need to enter the same login and password.
</p>

<h2 id="clearing_caches">Detailed instructions for clearing caches and cookies in various browsers</h2>

<p>When using a new release of Maqetta for the first time, it is generally a good idea to restart your browser and clear caches and any cookies associated with the Maqetta server. Details instructions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Quit and restart your browser before launching a new version of Maqetta for the first time.</strong>
		We have found occasional issues when switching from an old version
		of Maqetta to a newer version. </li>
	<li><strong>Clear both the browser's cache, cookes and "appcache" (offline storage):</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Chrome (version 19)
